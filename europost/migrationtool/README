Basically the way the IMAP Migration Tool works is:

1) index.php [HTML FORM] => submits to => archivesetup.php
2) archivesetup.php => writes to => archive.sh
3) archive.sh => run on command line by system admin => makes calls to archive.php
    for you, filling in the correct parameters. This will do the actual
    archiving or migrating of your messages.
    
Messages from IMAP folders will be placed in folders named the same.
BUT messages from INBOX will be placed in a folder named after the date ran
(Archived12May2004 for example). 
    
There are a couple of settings in archivesetup.conf that you probably want to change.
Make sure you take a look at that file and make the changes you need.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a list of all the files in this project and what they do.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
index.php - Supply this form to the end user.  Here they can type in their
		username and password to the source server and the
		destination server.

archivesetup.php - This will process the form from the above file and
		writes to scripts/archive.sh

archivesetup.conf - Configuration file for the above file.  ***You probably want
    to take a look at this file and make changes to your liking.

scripts/ - This directory must be writable by your webserver.
		It has the work horse script and the list of folders
		being archived/migrated.

archive.sh - Made by archivesetup.php.  It contains a list of all the
		folders being archived/migrated along with login info.
		It makes calls to archive.php (see below)

archive.php - This is the work horse script.  It moves one folder at a time
		and takes a lot of parameters.  archive.sh is what you should run
		and that in turn will call this file with all the parameters.

archive.conf - Configuration file for the above file.

resetscript.sh - This will wipe out archive.sh
